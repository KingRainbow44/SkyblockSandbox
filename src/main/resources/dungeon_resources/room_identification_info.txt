Identifying Dungeon Rooms:
1. Find paste location. (aka the middle of the schematic, or where the paste should take place)
2. Check the sign 1 block below the middle. (1 block below the redstone block)
3. Check the Text1-4 on the sign NBT for data.

Text1:
The first line contains the floor the room belongs to. This should be "zero" through "seven".
When generating, if the room is less than the number on the sign, it will ignore the room from generation.
To bypass this, place: "all" on the line.

"0" - Example.

Text2:
The second line contains the secrets belonging to that room. This should be a numerical long.
When playing, this number will be displayed to the user. If the number is 0, the user will be shown "No secrets".
To bypass this, write an identifier for the room. Examples of this are: "boss", "fairy", "blood".

"boss", "5" - Example.

Text3:
The third line contains data on how the room can be generated. This should be a series of 4 numerical integers.
When generating, this number is binary decoded and used to determine if a room can be placed in that location.
If true, it will paste. If false, it will see if it can rotate the schematic so it is in a valid position. Else, don't paste.
This is a special line. It cannot be bypassed and should be encoded with the schema: "north, south, east, west", "boolean, boolean, boolean, boolean".
The 4 numerical integers should represent a byte. Where there are 2 states. 1 = true; 0 = false.

In the chance where the room can be placed in any state, write 1111.

"1001"; Decodes to north, invalid, invalid, west - Example.
